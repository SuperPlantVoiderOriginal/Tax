    <h1> Job </h1>
    <p>  What does a job look like here?<br>
        Each day here is a very busy day here. <br>
        We sign in at the site and begin our day at 9 AM. We get emails from customers and take their details.  <br>
        We have a break every 2 hours and the break is usually 15 minutes long. <br>
        We have a gigantic break room, a balcony and a giant garden AND you can also work from home and there is <a href="pto.html">PTO</a>.     </p>
