    <h1> PTO </h1>
    <p>  How does PTO look here?<br>
        We have a weird PTO system. <br>
        We give our employees new laptops so they can work from anywhere no matter whenever and wherever.  <br>
        If you're sick you can contact your boss and they will set up your sick time system. <br>
        We believe that if you can't come but still want to get paid if your PTO days are up you can! Although if you're very sick you will get payed.  <br>
        Our system works like this; You have 30 PTO days and if you dont come you automatically use them. If you're sick but not extremely you dont use them unless you dont work. </p>
